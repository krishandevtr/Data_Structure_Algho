 * ! Array is a basic ds in every language
 * ! Representation of the data is defined by the compiler itself
 * ! Operation on the data is not defined by the compiler
 * ! We are responsible To provide the operations
 * ? All together we can call it has ADT
 * * ----Data------
 * ! Array space
 * ! Size 
 * ! Length(No of elements)
 * * -----Operations-----
 * ! Display();
 * ! Add(x)/Append(x);
 * ! Insert(index,x);
 * ! Delete(index);
 * ! Search(x);
 * ! Get(index);
 * ! set(index,x);
 * ! reverse();
 * ! Shift/Rotate()

/**
 * ? How to create the array space
 * ! Their are two ways 
 * ! dynamically in the heap // For large space// Size is determined in the runtime
 * !Ex-> int * A
 * ! A = new int[size]// the size  is from the user or we can collect during run time with required size
 * ! In static in the stack fixed // Size is determined in the compile time
 * ! Ex-> int arr[10];
